"Application layer protocol for transferring files over a TCP network. Allows browsing, uploading and downloading files. Authenticates using usernames and passwords.

"	
"Hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services and other resources on the internet. Translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses.

"	
"Network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. Enables dynamic addressing and network configuration.

"	
"Internet protocol that allows email clients to access and manipulate messages stored on a server. Allows organizing emails into folders. Keep messages synchronized across devices.

"	
"Protocol for receiving emails from a remote server. Downloads entire messages to a local client. Deleted from server after downloading. Good for intermittent connections.

"	
"Application layer protocol for sending email messages between servers. Uses TCP connections to transfer email data in plaintext.

"	
"Application layer protocol for interactive text-based sessions over a network. Provides bidirectional communication for terminal emulation. No encryption, so considered insecure.

"	
"Protocol for monitoring and managing network devices like routers, switches, printers etc. Uses UDP for agent-to-manager communications.

"	
"Application layer protocol used for client-server communication on the web. Clients make requests, servers respond with resources. Uses TCP as the transport protocol.

What does the <b>application</b> <b>layer</b> do in the OSI model	It is the actual software used by humans such as:<br><ul><li>Discord</li><li>Google Chrome/Opera (Web browsers)</li><li>Outlook/Thunderbird (Email clients)</li><li>Spotify desktop (any internet connected apps)</li></ul>
What does the <b>presentation</b> <b>layer</b> do in the OSI model	It prepares data for the application layer to read and session layer to transmit by:<br><ul><li>Compressing/decompressing data</li><li>Encrypting/decrypting data</li></ul><div>SSL (which encrypts data between webserver and browser) is an example of a presentation layer protocol.</div>
What does the&nbsp;<b>session</b>&nbsp;<b>layer</b>&nbsp;do in the OSI model	The session layer creates, maintains and ends connections.<br><br>E.g. when joining a minecraft server, the session layer contacts the server informing it you wish to join, ensures it is maintained while connected and closes it when you disconnect from the server
